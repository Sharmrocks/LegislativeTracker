# LegislativeTracker
I developed a system using Microsoft Access 2016 called The Legislative Process: Standard Procedure for Record Tracking. It helps track and manage legislative records, from initial filing to final action. I designed the database structure and created user-friendly forms to streamline data entry and ensure accurate record tracking throughout the legislative process.
